# get_next_line_mandatory

# get_next_line
- get_next_line() function should let
you read the text file pointed to by the file descriptor, one line at a time.
- Your function should return the line that was read.
If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred, it should return NULL.
- Make sure that your function works as expected both when reading a file and when
reading from the standard input.
- Please note that the returned line should include the terminating \n character,
except if the end of file was reached and does not end with a \n character.
